Welcome to the OLCPixelRayTracer repository. This project is designed to be a living tutorial on building up a raytracer
from scratch using the [OneLoneCoder PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

## Using This Repository

The intention is for this repository to be read in Git commit-history order, with commit messages (and this readme)
documenting the step-by-step process of building up a functional ray tracer. Please see
[the commit history](https://github.com/Sidneys1/OlcPixelRayTracer/commits/main) to get started.

## Tutorial

<details><summary>Expand previous steps</summary>

### 1. Create new, empty Visual Studio project.

First, <kbd>Create a new project</kbd> in Visual Studio, selecting the <kbd>Empty Project</kbd>
(`C++`/`Windows`/`Console`) template. I also opted for the flat directory structure option (<kbd>â˜‘ Place solution and
project in the same directory</kbd>).

Our project cannot currently run (there is no main entrypoint)!

### 2. Add PGE header and create a game from template.

We copy in the `olcPixelGameEngine.h` file and add it to our solution. We also add a blank `main.cpp` and populate it
with the contents of the template available in the `olcPixelGameEngine.h` header, taking care to rename our game class
to match our needs.

> Running our project will render a default PixelGameEngine scene: a 256x240 canvas of random pixels, magnified 4x.

### 3. Add basic Shapes and a vector of shapes to render.

We create a base class `Shape` and derived class `Sphere` (blank for now) that we will use to define our renderable
objects in the future.

We also add a `std::vector` of `std::unique_ptr<Shape>` to our game class. This will allow us to add new `Shape`-derived
objects to our scene.

Finally, when the game exits, the memory we allocated will be freed (thanks, smart pointers).

> Running our project will now render a solid magenta canvas.

### 4. Add constants and a way to "Sample" single pixels.

We define a few constants for window geometry and begin implementing our rendering process by looping over the rows and
columns of the scene and calling a `Sample` function that takes a floating-point x,y position on the viewport and
returns a `olc::Pixel` for that location.

> Running our project will now render a 250x250 canvas at 2x magnification. Our magenta fill has been replaced with a
> color pattern converging in the center of the canvas.

### 5. Add some geometry types, enhance Shape and Sphere.

We add structs for vectors and rays, and enhance our `Shape` and `Sphere` classes with properties that will allow us to
describe their size and position in our scene.

### 6. Add fog color and a way to sample rays.

To prevent our scene from extending into infinity, and to have something to show when a ray doesn't hit *anything*, we
add a new constant: a "fog" color. Additionally, we add a more specific function, `SampleRay`, that is called by
`Sample` to return the color (or absence thereof) of a ray as it extends into our scene. For now, still, this returns a
color relative to the X and Y coordinate in our scene.

> Running our project produces no differences from our last commit.

### 7. Add intersection and sample methods to Shapes.

Our `SampleRay` function has been upgraded to search for a `Shape` that it intersects with. To do this, `Shape` has been
upgraded with two new virtual methods:

* `std::optional<float> intersection(ray)`
* `olc::Pixel sample(ray)`

These methods provide the ability to determine where along a ray a `Shape` intersects, and to provide the color of the
`Shape` at a give ray intersection. Finally, our `Sphere` class overrides the `intersection` method, though for now the
implementation only returns an empty optional.

> Running our project produces no difference from the last commit.

### 8. Implement ray-Sphere intersection.

We'll need to overload some operators for a `vf3d`: subtraction, and dot-product. A dot-product is a useful way of
comparing two vectors to determine if they are similar.

We'll also implement the equation for an intersection between a ray and a `Sphere`. I'm not going to go into depth
explaining the geometry here: this is a well-documented process and can be researched separately.

> Running our project will now render a (highly aliased and flatly-colored) `Sphere`!
