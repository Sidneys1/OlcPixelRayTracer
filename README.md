Welcome to the OLCPixelRayTracer repository. This project is designed to be a living tutorial on building up a raytracer
from scratch using the [OneLoneCoder PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

## Using This Repository

The intention is for this repository to be read in Git commit-history order, with commit messages (and this readme)
documenting the step-by-step process of building up a functional ray tracer. Please see
[the commit history](https://github.com/Sidneys1/OlcPixelRayTracer/commits/main) to get started.

## Tutorial

<details><summary>Expand previous steps</summary>

### 1. Create new, empty Visual Studio project.

First, <kbd>Create a new project</kbd> in Visual Studio, selecting the <kbd>Empty Project</kbd>
(`C++`/`Windows`/`Console`) template. I also opted for the flat directory structure option (<kbd>â˜‘ Place solution and
project in the same directory</kbd>).

![Create a new project dialog](./docs/images/create-a-new-project.png)

Our project cannot currently run (there is no main entrypoint)!

### 2. Add PGE header and create a game from template.

We copy in the `olcPixelGameEngine.h` file and add it to our solution. We also add a blank `main.cpp` and populate it
with the contents of the template available in the `olcPixelGameEngine.h` header, taking care to rename our game class
to match our needs.

> Running our project will render a default PixelGameEngine scene: a 256x240 canvas of random pixels, magnified 4x.

### 3. Add basic Shapes and a vector of shapes to render.

We create a base class `Shape` and derived class `Sphere` (blank for now) that we will use to define our renderable
objects in the future.

We also add a `std::vector` of `std::unique_ptr<Shape>` to our game class. This will allow us to add new `Shape`-derived
objects to our scene.

Finally, when the game exits, the memory we allocated will be freed (thanks, smart pointers).

> Running our project will now render a solid magenta canvas.

### 4. Add constants and a way to "Sample" single pixels.

We define a few constants for window geometry and begin implementing our rendering process by looping over the rows and
columns of the scene and calling a `Sample` function that takes a floating-point x,y position on the viewport and
returns a `olc::Pixel` for that location.

> Running our project will now render a 250x250 canvas at 2x magnification. Our magenta fill has been replaced with a
> color pattern converging in the center of the canvas.

### 5. Add some geometry types, enhance Shape and Sphere.

We add structs for vectors and rays, and enhance our `Shape` and `Sphere` classes with properties that will allow us to
describe their size and position in our scene.

> Running our project produces no differences from the last commit.

### 6. Add fog color and a way to sample rays.

To prevent our scene from extending into infinity, and to have something to show when a ray doesn't hit *anything*, we
add a new constant: a "fog" color. Additionally, we add a more specific function, `SampleRay`, that is called by
`Sample` to return the color (or absence thereof) of a ray as it extends into our scene. For now, still, this returns a
color relative to the X and Y coordinate in our scene.

> Running our project produces no differences from our last commit.

### 7. Add intersection and sample methods to Shapes.

Our `SampleRay` function has been upgraded to search for a `Shape` that it intersects with. To do this, `Shape` has been
upgraded with two new virtual methods:

* `std::optional<float> intersection(ray)`
* `olc::Pixel sample(ray)`

These methods provide the ability to determine where along a ray a `Shape` intersects, and to provide the color of the
`Shape` at a give ray intersection. Finally, our `Sphere` class overrides the `intersection` method, though for now the
implementation only returns an empty optional.

> Running our project produces no difference from the last commit.

### 8. Implement ray-Sphere intersection.

We'll need to overload some operators for a `vf3d`: subtraction, and dot-product. A dot-product is a useful way of
comparing two vectors to determine if they are similar.

We'll also implement the equation for an intersection between a ray and a `Sphere`. I'm not going to go into depth
explaining the geometry here: this is a well-documented process and can be researched separately.

> Running our project will now render a (highly aliased and flatly-colored) `Sphere`!

### 9. Add perspective rendering and depth sorting.

First we'll add some additional `Sphere`s to our scene at different
Z-depths. If we run our project now, you'll see that the `Sphere`s added
to our scene last are drawn in front of the earlier ones, even if they
are further away.

To remedy that, we update our hit check in `SampleRay` to select the
`Shape` whose intersection is nearest to the ray origin.

> Now if we run our project, the `Sphere`s are properly sorted. **However**, you'll notice that all three `Sphere`s are
> the same size, despite being different distances from the camera.

<!-- TODO: enhance this section -->
To fix this, we'll need to add perspective to our camera. We'll do this in a very simplistic manner, by having all of
the rays originate from some point, and pointing towards what you can think of as a "virtual canvas" some distance in
front of that origin point. By normalizing this ray we get rays properly fanning out in a perspective.

> Running our project will now produce a proper perspective rendering of our three flat-shaded `Sphere`s, at the correct
> depths.

### 10. Add a Plane Shape, and apply Fog.

First we'll add a new type of `Shape`: a `Plane`. This is a flat surface extending infinitely in all directions. I'm not
going to go into depth about the intersection algorithm, as that's basic geometry and is better explained elsewhere.
Unlike a `Sphere`, orientation matters to a `Plane`, so we'll also add a "direction" `vf3d` that will indicate the
normal pointing away from the surface. We will also override the `sample` virtual method for the first time to provide a
checkerboard pattern that will make the perspective rendering we added last time really pop. To do this we'll also be
adding some new operator overloads to both `vf3d` and `ray`, and we'll also add a new method to `ray` that returns the
`vf3d` representing the endpoint of the `ray`. Finally, we'll add a new `Plane` to our scene just below our `Sphere`s.
Note that since we render our canvas top to bottom, +Y is down, while -Y is up.

> Running our project now you'll see the checkerboard pattern continue off to the horizon - **however**, it appears
> further up on the canvas than you might expect. **Additionally**, the checkerboard pattern gets very garbled as the
> checks gets smaller than a single pixel, creating a sort of unexpected and disorienting moire pattern. Perhaps drawing
> surfaces *that* far away isn't good...

To remedy this, we'll add the concept of Fog. We already have a Fog color, for when a ray doesn't hit anything. This new
concept applies the idea of there being some extremely translucency to the nothingness between a ray's origin and the
`Shape` it intersects with. We'll begin by adding two new constants, one to define the maximum distance at which an
`Shape` would be visible, and the other as the reciprocal of that. now when we're determining the color of a ray in
`SampleRay` we can check if the intersection distance is greater than that of the max Fog distance. If so, we'll
immediately return the Fog color and skip further calculation. If the distance is lower, however, we want to smoothly
transition between the `Shape`'s color and the Fog's color, depending on the distance.

To do this, we'll implement a function called `lerp` - short for "linear interpolation". This just smoothly mixes two
colors based on a floating point value between 0 and 1.

> into the distance.

Note that as our scene and renderer grow in complexity we'll begin to see lower and lower frame-rates when running our
project. Switching our compilation mode to Release and running without debugging can help, as the compiler will more
aggressively apply optimizations. Feel free to experiment with optimization strategies in the Release compilation
settings.

### 11. Add reflections.

Reflections are an intrinsic feature of any raytracer. To begin, let's add a new constant to control just how many times
a ray may reflect as it makes its way through the scene. Imagine being inside a hall of mirrors - the reflections may
continue to some recursive depth - in real life, this is infinite (or at least to the degree allowed by the quality of
the mirrors and available light). In our project, reflections add more computational complexity, so limiting the degree
to which these reflections propagate is essential. To do so, I've surrounded two different values for this constant in
preprocessor "if" statements to provide different values under Debug and Release mode respectively.

Next we'll add a property to our base `Shape` class - a floating point representing `reflectivity`. This will range
between 0 (no reflections) and 1 (a perfect mirror). We'll also initialize this as a constructor parameter, and extend
that parameter to the `Sphere` class as well. Next, we'll make the surfaces of our first and second `Sphere`s to be
reflective. Lastly, we'll add a new abstract method to our `Shape` class that will return the normal at a given
intersection point, and override this abstract method in our `Sphere` and `Plane` classes. A normal is simply a ray
pointing outwards from the surface of the `Shape` at the given point.

Next, let's enhance our `SampleRay` method by adding a parameter for how many "bounces" are allowed - as this method is
called recursively we'll decrement this value, at at the point where bounces is zero we'll stop processing more
reflections. We'll pass the initial bounces constant into the `SampleRay` method from the `Sample` method. Once we've
sampled our `Shape` and determined its intrinsic color, we need to created a reflected ray and sample that to determine
the color that would be reflected by this `Shape` - we can skip this process if the reflectivity is zero or if we've
reached the max depth. Creating a reflected ray is a simple geometric function between the direction of the original
`sample_ray` and the `Shape`'s normal at the intersection point. Finally, we sample this new ray (passing in the new,
decremented bounces count). We'll mix our `final_color` between the intrinsic color of this `Shape` itself and the color
we sampled along the reflected ray (or, if it didn't hit anything, our Fog color).

> Running our project at this point produces a beautifully rendered scene where the center and left `Sphere`s reflect
> their surroundings - and a sharp eye can determine that the left `Sphere` can even see itself in its reflection of the
> center `Sphere`.

To further highlight the reflections we'll add some simple motion to the scene by accumulating time in the
`OnUserUpdate` function, and modifying the Y and Z coordinates of the center `Sphere` along a sine/cosine wave
respectively.

> Running our project now will display a smoothly floating `Sphere`, with appropriate reflections of its surrounding
> `Shapes`.

### 12. Create and use a `color3` type.

To simplify some upcoming features, let's replace our use of `olc::Pixel` with our own color type. Since we're used to
representing color as the combination of three values - red, green, and blue - we can represent each with a floating
point value between 0 and 1.

Looking at our code, we already have a type to represent three floating point values: `vf3d`. Using a simple `using`
alias, we can create a type alias called `color3` that is really a `vf3d` behind the scenes. This aliasing isn't really
necessary, but it will help avoid confusion. Additionally, we can leverage the `olc::PixelF` type to convert our
floating point color to one compatible with PixelGameEngine.

> Running our project now produces no difference from our previous commit.

### 13. Add diffuse lighting.

Let's add a single point light source to our scene. We'll add a member to our game class to represent this. We'll use a
class member instead of a constant so that we can change the position of the light later. We'll initialize this value in
the constructor to be 500 units behind and 500 units above our origin.

Diffuse lighting is frighteningly simple - we already know that a dot product between two vectors returns a value that
roughly describes the similarity of the vectors. To implement simple diffuse lighting, we can multiply our sample color
by a dot product between the surface normal vector and a vector pointing towards our single light source.

Let's add a section to our `SampleRay` function after we apply reflections where we'll apply diffuse lighting. The
process only requires three lines of code! First we'll create a normalized ray at the intersection point, pointing
towards the light point (we do this by subtracting the light point from the intersection point). Secondly, we'll
calculate the dot product between our light ray and the surface normal we already have.

Running our project now will highlight a problem: the top halves of our `Shape`s look correct (towards the light), but
the bottoms have a corrupted look. You'll remember that the dot product of two vectors lies in the range -1 to 1. As we
reach the side of our `Shape`s pointing away from the light, our dot product enters the negative range - and "negative"
colors are certainly a concept our data types are unprepared to handle! To fix this let's clamp the dot product value to
the range 0 to 1 - this way all negative values are discarded.

> Running our project now looks correct! The tops of our `Shape`s are light, while the bottoms are almost pitch black.
> **However**, since darkness isn't terribly interesting, let's add a global ambient light, which we'll implement as a
> new constant.

By adding our global light value to the dot product we'll ensure that our diffuse lighting never
completely darkens our scene.

> Running our project now displays simple diffuse lighting without darkening any parts of our scene entirely.
